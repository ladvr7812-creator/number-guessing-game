🎮 Number Guessing Game
A simple interactive Python game where the computer thinks of a random number and you try to guess it!
📝 Description
This is my first Python project as a B.Tech IT student. The game generates a random number between 1 and 10, and the player has to guess it. After each guess, the game provides hints ("Too high!" or "Too low!") to help the player find the correct number.
✨ Features

Random number generation
Interactive user input
Hints after each guess (too high/too low)
Attempt counter to track your performance
Simple and clean interface

🚀 How to Play

Run the program
The computer will think of a number between 1 and 10
Enter your guess
Follow the hints (Too high/Too low)
Keep guessing until you find the correct number!
The game will tell you how many attempts it took

💻 Requirements

Python 3.x
No external libraries needed (uses built-in random module)

📦 Installation

Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
Download the game.py file
Open terminal/command prompt
Navigate to the folder containing the file
Run: python game.py

🎯 Example Gameplay
Welcome to Number Guessing Game!!
I think the number between 1 to 10

Enter the Guessing no: 5
Too high!, Try Again

Enter the Guessing no: 3
Too Low!, Try Again

Enter the Guessing no: 4
Congratulation You Win!
You Guess the No in 3 attempts
📚 What I Learned
While building this project, I learned:

Using the random module in Python
Working with while loops
Using conditional statements (if/elif/else)
Getting user input with input()
Type conversion with int()
Counting and tracking variables
Writing clean, commented code

🔮 Future Improvements
Ideas for making this game better:

 Add difficulty levels (Easy: 1-10, Medium: 1-50, Hard: 1-100)
 Limit the number of attempts
 Add a scoring system
 "Play again" option
 Show how close the guess is (very close, close, far)
 Keep a high score record
